# SimLane Billing System Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating SimLane's existing club system to a subscription-based billing model using Stripe. The migration will introduce tiered subscription plans that gate advanced features like race planning while maintaining backward compatibility for existing users.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Club System**: Robust club management with role-based permissions (Admin, Teams Manager, Member)
- **Member Management**: ClubMember model with established relationships and permissions
- **Race Planning**: Advanced EventParticipation, RaceStrategy, and StintPlan models
- **Event Management**: ClubEventSignupSheet system for organizing team events
- **User Base**: Active clubs with varying member counts and engagement levels

### Key Findings
- No existing billing system or subscription management
- Some clubs may already exceed Free plan limits (5 members)
- Race planning features are currently unrestricted
- Strong foundation for subscription enforcement through existing permission decorators

## Subscription Tier Structure

### Free Plan
- **Member Limit**: 5 active members
- **Features**: Basic club management, member invitations, event viewing
- **Restrictions**: No race planning, no team formation tools
- **Target**: Small clubs, trial users, casual communities

### Basic Plan ($9.99/month)
- **Member Limit**: 25 active members
- **Features**: All Free features + race planning, team formation, strategy management
- **Target**: Active racing clubs, organized teams

### Pro Plan ($24.99/month)
- **Member Limit**: Unlimited members
- **Features**: All Basic features + advanced analytics, priority support
- **Target**: Large communities, professional teams, league organizers

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)
**Objective**: Deploy billing system without enforcement

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate billing
   python manage.py setup_subscription_plans
   ```

2. **Initial Plan Assignment**
   - All existing clubs assigned to Free plan
   - No immediate enforcement of limits
   - Billing system operational but permissive

3. **Admin Interface**
   - Billing models available in Django admin
   - Subscription management tools for staff
   - Monitoring dashboards operational

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Billing app deployed without errors
- [ ] All existing clubs have Free plan subscriptions
- [ ] Admin can manage subscriptions manually
- [ ] No disruption to existing functionality

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 3-4)
**Objective**: Enable subscription management with grace period

#### User Communication
1. **Announcement Email** (1 week before enforcement)
   ```
   Subject: Introducing SimLane Pro - Enhanced Features for Racing Clubs
   
   We're excited to announce SimLane Pro, bringing advanced race planning 
   tools to your club. Your club will continue to have full access to all 
   features for the next 30 days while you explore our new subscription options.
   ```

2. **In-App Notifications**
   - Dashboard banners explaining new subscription system
   - Feature callouts highlighting Pro benefits
   - Upgrade prompts for clubs approaching limits

#### Technical Rollout
1. **Subscription Dashboard**
   - Club admins can view current plan and usage
   - Upgrade/downgrade options available
   - Billing history and invoice access

2. **Stripe Integration**
   - Checkout sessions functional
   - Webhook processing operational
   - Payment method management

3. **Grace Period Logic**
   ```python
   # Allow all features during grace period
   BILLING_GRACE_PERIOD_END = datetime(2024, 2, 15)
   
   def is_grace_period_active():
       return timezone.now() < BILLING_GRACE_PERIOD_END
   ```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Subscription dashboard accessible to club admins
- [ ] Payment processing working end-to-end
- [ ] User communications sent successfully
- [ ] No user complaints about access restrictions

### Phase 3: Enforcement Rollout (Week 5-6)
**Objective**: Gradually enforce subscription limits

#### Enforcement Strategy
1. **Member Limit Enforcement** (Day 1)
   - Prevent new member additions beyond plan limits
   - Existing members remain active
   - Clear messaging about upgrade requirements

2. **Race Planning Restrictions** (Day 3)
   - Block creation of new RaceStrategy and StintPlan objects
   - Existing race plans remain accessible
   - Upgrade prompts on restricted actions

3. **Team Formation Limits** (Day 5)
   - Restrict EventParticipation team formation features
   - Basic event signup remains available
   - Advanced team management requires subscription

#### Oversized Club Handling
For clubs exceeding Free plan limits:

1. **Automatic Identification**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate_existing_clubs --report-only
   ```

2. **Outreach Strategy**
   - Personal emails to club admins
   - Offer 50% discount for first 3 months
   - Dedicated support for migration questions

3. **Grandfathering Options**
   - 60-day grace period for oversized clubs
   - Option to remove members to fit Free plan
   - Assisted migration to paid plans

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Member limits enforced without breaking existing clubs
- [ ] Race planning restrictions working correctly
- [ ] Oversized clubs contacted and supported
- [ ] Payment conversion rate > 15% for affected clubs

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (Week 7-8)
**Objective**: Complete migration with full feature enforcement

#### Final Enforcement
1. **All Restrictions Active**
   - Member limits strictly enforced
   - Race planning requires Basic+ subscription
   - Team formation features gated appropriately

2. **Monitoring and Support**
   - 24/7 monitoring of billing system
   - Dedicated support channel for billing issues
   - Regular review of subscription metrics

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] All subscription features working as designed
- [ ] Support ticket volume manageable
- [ ] Revenue targets met or exceeded
- [ ] User satisfaction maintained

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration Strategy

#### Existing Club Analysis
```sql
-- Identify clubs by member count
SELECT 
    c.name,
    c.slug,
    COUNT(cm.id) as member_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(cm.id) <= 5 THEN 'Free'
        WHEN COUNT(cm.id) <= 25 THEN 'Basic'
        ELSE 'Pro'
    END as recommended_plan
FROM teams_club c
LEFT JOIN teams_clubmember cm ON c.id = cm.club_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.slug
ORDER BY member_count DESC;
```

#### Migration Command Implementation
```python
# simlane/billing/management/commands/migrate_existing_clubs.py
class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        free_plan = SubscriptionPlan.objects.get(name='Free')
        
        for club in Club.objects.all():
            subscription, created = ClubSubscription.objects.get_or_create(
                club=club,
                defaults={
                    'plan': free_plan,
                    'status': 'active',
                    'current_period_start': timezone.now(),
                    'current_period_end': timezone.now() + timedelta(days=365),
                }
            )
            
            if created:
                self.stdout.write(f"Created subscription for {club.name}")
```

### Subscription Enforcement Logic

#### Decorator Implementation
```python
# simlane/billing/decorators.py
def subscription_required(feature_name):
    def decorator(view_func):
        @wraps(view_func)
        def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
            club = get_club_from_request(request)
            
            if not club.subscription.has_feature(feature_name):
                return render(request, 'billing/upgrade_required.html', {
                    'club': club,
                    'feature': feature_name,
                    'required_plan': get_required_plan(feature_name)
                })
            
            return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

#### Model Integration
```python
# simlane/billing/models.py
class ClubSubscription(models.Model):
    def get_member_usage(self):
        return self.club.members.filter(
            created_at__lte=self.current_period_end
        ).count()
    
    def can_add_member(self):
        if self.plan.max_members is None:  # Unlimited
            return True
        return self.get_member_usage() < self.plan.max_members
    
    def has_feature(self, feature_name):
        features = self.plan.features_json or {}
        return features.get(feature_name, False)
```

### Stripe Integration

#### Webhook Security
```python
# simlane/billing/views.py
@csrf_exempt
def stripe_webhook(request):
    payload = request.body
    sig_header = request.META.get('HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE')
    
    try:
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
            payload, sig_header, settings.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        )
    except ValueError:
        return HttpResponse(status=400)
    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError:
        return HttpResponse(status=400)
    
    # Process event
    handle_stripe_event(event)
    return HttpResponse(status=200)
```

#### Subscription Lifecycle Management
```python
def handle_subscription_updated(event):
    stripe_subscription = event['data']['object']
    
    try:
        subscription = ClubSubscription.objects.get(
            stripe_subscription_id=stripe_subscription['id']
        )
        
        subscription.status = stripe_subscription['status']
        subscription.current_period_start = datetime.fromtimestamp(
            stripe_subscription['current_period_start']
        )
        subscription.current_period_end = datetime.fromtimestamp(
            stripe_subscription['current_period_end']
        )
        subscription.save()
        
        # Log the event
        BillingEventLog.objects.create(
            stripe_event_id=event['id'],
            event_type='subscription.updated',
            club_subscription=subscription,
            data_json=event['data']
        )
        
    except ClubSubscription.DoesNotExist:
        logger.error(f"Subscription not found: {stripe_subscription['id']}")
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Database Performance
- **Risk**: Subscription checks on every request
- **Mitigation**: Redis caching for subscription status
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  @cached_property
  def subscription_status(self):
      cache_key = f"club_subscription_{self.club.id}"
      return cache.get_or_set(cache_key, self._get_subscription_status, 300)
  ```

#### Payment Processing Failures
- **Risk**: Stripe webhook failures causing data inconsistency
- **Mitigation**: Idempotent webhook processing with retry logic
- **Implementation**: Event deduplication and manual reconciliation tools

#### Feature Regression
- **Risk**: Subscription checks breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage and gradual rollout
- **Implementation**: Feature flags for subscription enforcement

### Business Risks

#### User Churn
- **Risk**: Existing users leaving due to new restrictions
- **Mitigation**: Generous grace periods and grandfathering options
- **Monitoring**: Weekly retention reports and user feedback analysis

#### Revenue Shortfall
- **Risk**: Lower than expected conversion rates
- **Mitigation**: Flexible pricing and promotional offers
- **Contingency**: Ability to adjust plan limits and pricing

#### Support Overload
- **Risk**: High volume of billing-related support requests
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and self-service options
- **Preparation**: Additional support staff during migration period
