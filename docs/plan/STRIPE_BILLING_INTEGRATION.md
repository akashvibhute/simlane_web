# Stripe Billing Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating Stripe billing into the SimLane Django application. The integration will introduce subscription-based pricing tiers that gate access to premium features, particularly race planning functionality, while maintaining the existing club management structure.

## Subscription Tier Structure

### Free Tier
- **Price**: $0/month
- **Member Limit**: 5 members per club
- **Features**:
  - Basic club management
  - Event browsing and participation
  - Basic member management
  - iRacing integration
- **Restrictions**:
  - No race planning features
  - No team formation for events
  - No strategy planning tools

### Basic Tier
- **Price**: $9.99/month
- **Member Limit**: 25 members per club
- **Features**:
  - All Free tier features
  - Race planning and strategy tools
  - Team formation for events
  - Stint planning
  - Basic analytics
- **Target Audience**: Small to medium racing clubs

### Pro Tier
- **Price**: $29.99/month
- **Member Limit**: Unlimited members
- **Features**:
  - All Basic tier features
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - Priority support
  - Custom integrations (future)
  - Advanced team management tools
- **Target Audience**: Large racing organizations and professional teams

## Feature Gating Strategy

### Race Planning Features
The following features will be gated behind paid subscriptions (Basic and Pro tiers):

1. **EventParticipation Team Formation**
   - Creating and managing teams for events
   - Assigning drivers to specific roles
   - Team strategy coordination

2. **RaceStrategy Management**
   - Creating race strategies
   - Editing strategy parameters
   - Sharing strategies with team members

3. **StintPlan Operations**
   - Creating stint plans
   - Driver rotation planning
   - Fuel and tire strategy planning

### Member Limit Enforcement
- Free tier clubs cannot exceed 5 active members
- Basic tier clubs cannot exceed 25 active members
- Pro tier clubs have unlimited members
- Existing members are grandfathered during plan downgrades
- New member invitations are blocked when limits are reached

## Technical Architecture

### Core Models

#### SubscriptionPlan
```python
class SubscriptionPlan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # Free, Basic, Pro
    stripe_price_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    max_members = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)  # None for unlimited
    monthly_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    features_json = models.JSONField(default=dict)  # Feature flags
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

#### ClubSubscription
```python
class ClubSubscription(models.Model):
    club = models.OneToOneField('teams.Club', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    plan = models.ForeignKey(SubscriptionPlan, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    stripe_customer_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    stripe_subscription_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_CHOICES)
    current_period_start = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    current_period_end = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    seats_used = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

#### BillingEventLog
```python
class BillingEventLog(models.Model):
    stripe_event_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    event_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    club_subscription = models.ForeignKey(ClubSubscription, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
    processed_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    data_json = models.JSONField()
    processing_status = models.CharField(max_length=20, default='pending')
```

### Service Layer Architecture

#### StripeService
Handles all Stripe API interactions:
- Customer creation and management
- Checkout session creation
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Webhook event processing
- Payment method management

#### SubscriptionService
Manages subscription business logic:
- Subscription status validation
- Feature access checking
- Member limit enforcement
- Plan upgrade/downgrade logic
- Usage calculation and reporting

### Webhook Handling

#### Supported Webhook Events
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`

#### Webhook Security
- Stripe signature verification using webhook secret
- Idempotency handling using event IDs
- Comprehensive logging of all webhook events
- Retry mechanism for failed webhook processing

#### Webhook Processing Flow
1. Verify Stripe signature
2. Check for duplicate event processing
3. Parse webhook payload
4. Update local subscription status
5. Trigger relevant Django signals
6. Log processing results

## API Design

### Subscription Management Endpoints

#### GET /api/clubs/{club_slug}/subscription/
Returns current subscription details:
```json
{
  "plan": {
    "name": "Basic",
    "max_members": 25,
    "monthly_price": "9.99",
    "features": ["race_planning", "team_formation"]
  },
  "status": "active",
  "current_period_end": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
  "seats_used": 12,
  "seats_available": 13
}
```

#### POST /api/clubs/{club_slug}/subscription/checkout/
Creates Stripe checkout session:
```json
{
  "price_id": "price_1234567890",
  "success_url": "https://app.simlane.com/billing/success",
  "cancel_url": "https://app.simlane.com/billing/cancel"
}
```

#### POST /api/clubs/{club_slug}/subscription/portal/
Creates Stripe customer portal session for subscription management.

### Enhanced Club API Responses
All club API endpoints will include subscription context:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Racing Club",
  "subscription": {
    "plan_name": "Basic",
    "status": "active",
    "features_enabled": ["race_planning"],
    "member_limit_reached": false
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- HTTP 402 Payment Required for subscription-gated features
- HTTP 403 Forbidden for member limit violations
- Detailed error messages with upgrade prompts
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Stripe Integration Security
- Webhook endpoint protection with signature verification
- Secure storage of Stripe keys in environment variables
- PCI compliance through Stripe's hosted checkout
- No storage of payment card data on SimLane servers

### Access Control
- Subscription checks integrated with existing permission system
- Feature flags validated on both frontend and backend
- API rate limiting for billing endpoints
- Audit logging for all subscription changes

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive billing data at rest
- Secure transmission of all payment-related data
- GDPR compliance for billing information
- Data retention policies for billing events

## Migration Plan for Existing Clubs

### Pre-Migration Assessment
1. **Club Size Analysis**
   - Count current members for all existing clubs
   - Identify clubs exceeding Free tier limits (>5 members)
   - Generate migration impact report

2. **Feature Usage Analysis**
   - Identify clubs currently using race planning features
   - Assess impact of feature gating on existing users
   - Plan communication strategy for affected clubs

### Migration Strategy

#### Automatic Migration
- All existing clubs assigned to Free tier initially
- Clubs with â‰¤5 members: No immediate action required
- Clubs with >5 members: Grace period with feature access

#### Grace Period Implementation
- 30-day grace period for oversized clubs
- Full feature access maintained during grace period
- Progressive notifications about upcoming restrictions
- Easy upgrade path provided throughout grace period

#### Communication Plan
1. **Pre-Migration (2 weeks before)**
   - Email announcement to all club admins
   - In-app notifications about upcoming changes
   - FAQ and upgrade information provided

2. **During Migration**
   - Real-time migration status updates
   - Support team availability for questions
   - Immediate upgrade options for affected clubs

3. **Post-Migration**
   - Follow-up emails with upgrade incentives
   - Usage analytics and recommendations
   - Ongoing support for billing questions

### Rollback Procedures
- Database backup before migration execution
- Feature flag system for quick billing disable
- Rollback scripts for subscription assignments
- Emergency contact procedures for critical issues
