# SimLane Club Management Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the comprehensive club management system for SimLane.

## Current Status: 40% Complete ⚠️

### 🎯 **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE SIMPLIFICATION COMPLETED** ✅
**Decision**: Remove `ClubEvent` model and use existing `sim.Event` with enhanced race planning capabilities.

**Rationale**: 
- `sim.Event` already has `organizing_club` and `organizing_user` fields
- Universal race planning should be available to all users, not just club members
- Clubs can participate in any event (official, user-created, or club-organized)
- Eliminates data duplication and complexity

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ ClubEvent model removed from models.py
- ✅ Migration applied successfully
- ✅ Admin registration removed
- ✅ API endpoints removed
- ✅ Forms removed
- ✅ Basic import cleanup completed
- ⚠️ Views cleanup pending (many ClubEvent references remain)
- ⚠️ URL patterns need updating
- ⚠️ Templates need updating
